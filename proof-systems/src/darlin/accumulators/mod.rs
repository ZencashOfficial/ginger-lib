//! Trait for general (public, or "atomic") accumulation schemes [BCMS20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/499).
//! Comes with the aggregation/verification of "items", i.e. some data structure typically satisfying a 
//! non-efficient predicate).  
//! The trait applies to mixed type accumulators as described in our Darlin Proof Tree document:
//! There, a (full) accumulator is a composite structure of dlog and inner sumcheck ("single") accumulators, 
//! from both groups of the EC cycle (the "current", and the "collected" ones). 
//! Although within recursion we do not separate accumulation strategy from the SNARK on protocol level,
//! we nevertheless serve this functionality for post processing outside the PCD.
